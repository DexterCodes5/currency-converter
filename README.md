Initially I started the Node js project with Typescript and ES modules, which turned out to be a really bad idea. Firstly I bearly got it working, I lost a ton of time and then I couldn't import json, I couldn't use __dirname and when I wrote to the json file, Javascript wrote in the compiled code.
Therefore I created the project with plain Javascript and CommonJs.
